## Bugs
* When naming a new dashboard, it saves when I start typing. Also results in a dashboard with no pages  
* iFrame with query string params
* Admin pages are not locked down if you know the URL

## Todo

* Proper REST API for admin pages. Perhaps using ng resources
* Installation documentation - perhaps in readme.md
* Force a client onto a specific dashboard 
* Broadcast mode - force all clients to a specific dashboard until told to change back
  * ~~Started Admin pages~~
* Pause Carousel
* Allow editing of builds from frontend
* Clean up CSS/HTML/JS 
* AngularMaterial
* Angular 2


## Done

* ~~Fix real time~~
* ~~Optimize build status query~~
* ~~Landing page~~
* ~~Multiple dashboards~~
* ~~Neaten up dashboard admin~~
* ~~Config per widget instance~~
* ~~iFrame widget~~
* ~~Youtube Widget~~
* ~~Carousel timing configuration~~
* ~~Remember connected clients~~
  * ~~Allow user to give aliases~~
  * ~~Send message to specific client to identify itself~~
  * ~~Query which dashboard a client is showing~~
  * ~~Remember which dashboard a client should show as default (i.e. when navigating to /, redirect is saved otherwise)~~
