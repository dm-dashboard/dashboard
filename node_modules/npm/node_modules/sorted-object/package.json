  "readme": "# Get a Version of an Object with Sorted Keys\n\nAlthough objects in JavaScript are theoretically unsorted, in practice most engines use insertion orderâ€”at least, ignoring numeric keys. This manifests itself most prominently when dealing with an object's JSON serialization.\n\nSo, for example, you might be trying to serialize some object to a JSON file. But every time you write it, it ends up being output in a different order, depending on how you created it in the first place! This makes for some ugly diffs.\n\n**sorted-object** gives you the answer. Just use this package to create a version of your object with its keys sorted before serializing, and you'll get a consistent order every time.\n\n```js\nvar sortedObject = require(\"sorted-object\");\n\nvar objectToSerialize = generateStuffNondeterministically();\n\n// Before:\nfs.writeFileSync(\"dest.json\", JSON.stringify(objectToSerialize));\n\n// After:\nvar sortedVersion = sortedObject(objectToSerialize);\nfs.writeFileSync(\"dest.json\", JSON.stringify(sortedVersion));\n```\n",
